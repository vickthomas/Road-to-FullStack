<!--If you want to challenge yourself:

Create a form with multiple fields that accept user input.
Add two separate sets of radio buttons or checkboxes.
Search how to add placeholder (hint hint) to an input field. A placeholder shows ups when the field has no value, it disappears after the user types or selects something in the field.-->
